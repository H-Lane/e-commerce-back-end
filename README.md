# e-commerce-back-end

Week 13 Challenge

## Description

This project was created to improve my skills working with SQL databases and create a functioning API for a potential e-commerce company. This project makes use of Sequelize and Postgres to handle database management and express for creating routes for the backend. Through this project I have become very familiar with writing various RESTful CRUD based requests, as well as creating Sequelize classes to fill those requests.
